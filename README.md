# cornermaster
CornerMaster is a C++ tool that computes optimal cornering speeds based on polynomial models of track curves and elevation. It calculates arc length, radius of curvature, and a difficulty coefficient, then determines the best speeds for cornering and exiting, considering tire grip, car weight, and acceleration.
